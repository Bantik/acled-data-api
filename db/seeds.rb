# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# Code for converting dates into strings
# Event.all.each do |event|
#   date = event.event_date.split("/")
#   month = date[0].to_i
#   day = date[1].to_i
#   year = date[2].to_i
#   event.update(:date => Date.new(year, month, day))
#   print "."
# end
